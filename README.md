# Punish Me: Devil Habit Tracker

Punish Me is a habit tracking app with a twist. Unlike other habit trackers, Punish Me not only helps you set up and track your habits, but it also punishes you if you fail to stick to them. This app is designed to keep you motivated and disciplined by using various punishment strategies.

## Key Features:
- **ðŸ”¥ Define your own habits:** Choose what you want to improve, from exercising to drinking more water.
- **ðŸ˜ˆ Progressive punishment system:** Each failure brings more annoyance. Notifications intensify until you regain your discipline.
- **ðŸ“¢ Custom alerts:** Irritating sounds, sarcastic messages, and relentless notifications that wonâ€™t leave you alone.
- **ðŸŽ­ Extreme Evil Mode:** For the bravest, activate additional punishments like interface glitches or feature blocks.
- **ðŸ“ˆ Failure history:** Because sometimes you need to see how often youâ€™ve fallenâ€¦ to avoid repeating it.

## Technologies

- **React Native**: The app is built using React Native for a seamless cross-platform experience.
- **Expo**: Utilized for development and building the app.
- **EAS (Expo Application Services)**: Used for building and deploying the app.
